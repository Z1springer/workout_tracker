## Description

As a user, I want to be able to track my workouts daily. I want to be able to add new exercises to each workout and be able to keep track of my reps, sets, weight, duration, and more. With this app I hope to keep track of each workout that I do and store all my workouts for future use!

Then you can create an exercise for that workout, and as long as you enter in which workout you want to add a new exercise to, you can keep adding to that workout!
